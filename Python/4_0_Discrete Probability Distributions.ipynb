    "### Binomial Distribution\n",
    "A binomial distribution can be thought of as simply the probability of a SUCCESS or FAILURE outcome in an experiment or survey that is repeated multiple times. The binomial is a type of distribution that has two possible outcomes (the prefix **_‚Äúbi‚Äù_** means two, or twice). For example, a coin toss has only two possible outcomes: heads or tails and taking a test could have two possible outcomes: pass or fail."

    "* **The number of observations or trials is fixed.** In other words, you can only figure out the probability of something happening if you do it a certain number of times. This is common sense‚Äîif you toss a coin once, your probability of getting a tails is 50%. If you toss a coin a 20 times, your probability of getting a tails is very, very close to 100%\n",
    "* **Each observation or trial is independent.** In other words, none of your trials have an effect on the probability of the next trial\n",
    "* **The probability of success** (tails, heads, fail or pass) is exactly the same from one trial to another\n",
    "* The probability of an observation being classified as the event of interest, $\\large \\bf \\pi$, is constant from observation to observation. Thus, the probability of an observation being classified as not being the event of interest, $\\large \\bf{1-\\bf{\\pi}}$, is constant over all observations"

    "A textbook store rents an average of 200 books every Saturday night. Using this data, you can predict the probability that more books will sell (perhaps 300 or 400) on the following Saturday nights. Another example is the number of diners in a certain restaurant every day. If the average number of diners for seven days is 500, you can predict the probability of a certain day having more customers."
