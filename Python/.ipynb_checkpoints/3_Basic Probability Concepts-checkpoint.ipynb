    "In a _**priori probability**_,the probability of an occurrence is based on priori knowledge of the process involved. For example, number of ways the event occurs and the total number of possible outcomes are known from the composition of the deck of cards or the faces of the die.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the _**empirical probability**_ approach, the probabilities are based on observed data, not on priori knowledge process. For example, Surverys are often used to generate empirical probabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "_**subjective probability**_ differs from the other two approaches because, this type of probability differs from person to person, hence the name **Subjective**. This probability is usually based on individuals's past experience, personal opinion, and analysis of a particular situation. Subjective probability is especially useful in making decisions in situations in which you cannot use _**a priori**_ probability or _**empirical probability**_."
