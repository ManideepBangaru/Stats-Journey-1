    "### Normal Distribution\n",
    "The normal distribution is not only symmetrical, but bell-shaped, a shape that (loosely) suggests the profile of a bell. Being bell-shaped means that most values of the continuous variable will cluster around the mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Uniform Distribution\n",
    "It is also known as rectangular distribution, contains the values that are equally distributed in the range between the minimum value and the maximum value.\n",
    "In a uniform distribution every value has a equal chance of occurrence\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exponential Distribution\n",
    "The exponential distribution contains values from zero to positive infinity and is right-skewed, making the mean greater than the median\n",

    "### Properties of Normal Distribution\n",
    "* Symmetrical distribution. Its mean and median are therefore equal\n",
    "* Bell-shaped. Values cluster around the mean\n",
    "* Interquartile range is roughly 1.33 standard deviations. Therefore, the middle 50% of the values are contained within an interval that is approximately two-thirds of a standard deviation below and two-thirds of a standard deviation above the mean\n",
